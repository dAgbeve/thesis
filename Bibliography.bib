	Abstract = {With the ever-growing usage of batteries in the IoT era, the need for more eco-friendly technologies is clear. RFpowered computing enables the re-design of personal computing devices in a battery-less manner. While there has been substantial work on the underlying methods for RF-powered computing, practical applications of this technology has largely been limited to scenarios that involve simple tasks. This article demonstrates how RFID technology, typically used to implement object identification and counting, can be exploited to realize a battery-free Smart Home. In particular, we consider the coexistence of several battery-free devices, with different transmission requirements — periodic, event based, and realtime — and propose a new adaptive and quick-to-learn MAC protocol, called APT-MAC, which dynamically collects information from devices without requiring any a priori knowledge of the environment. Extensive simulations clearly show the benefits of using APT-MAC, which is able to successfully deliver 97.7% of new data samples in complex scenarios, including several high traffic demanding devices such as joysticks and cameras},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

	Abstract = {We present a review of the use of diode lasers in atomic physics with an extensive list of references. We discuss the relevant characteristics of diode lasers and explain how to purchase and use them. We also review the various techniques that have been used to control and narrow the spectral outputs of diode lasers. Finally we present a number of examples illustrating the use of diode lasers in atomic physics experiments. Review of Scientific Instruments is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.},
