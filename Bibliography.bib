	Abstract = {With the ever-growing usage of batteries in the IoT era, the need for more eco-friendly technologies is clear. RFpowered computing enables the re-design of personal computing devices in a battery-less manner. While there has been substantial work on the underlying methods for RF-powered computing, practical applications of this technology has largely been limited to scenarios that involve simple tasks. This article demonstrates how RFID technology, typically used to implement object identification and counting, can be exploited to realize a battery-free Smart Home. In particular, we consider the coexistence of several battery-free devices, with different transmission requirements — periodic, event based, and realtime — and propose a new adaptive and quick-to-learn MAC protocol, called APT-MAC, which dynamically collects information from devices without requiring any a priori knowledge of the environment. Extensive simulations clearly show the benefits of using APT-MAC, which is able to successfully deliver 97.7% of new data samples in complex scenarios, including several high traffic demanding devices such as joysticks and cameras},

	Abstract = {The adoption of wireless sensor networks by applications that require complex operations, ranging from health care to industrial monitoring, has brought forward a new challenge of fulfilling the quality of service (QoS) requirements of these applications. However, providing QoS support is a challenging issue due to highly resource constrained nature of sensor nodes, unreliable wireless links and harsh operation environments. In this paper, we focus on the QoS support at the MAC layer which forms the basis of communication stack and has the ability to tune key QoS-specific parameters, such as duty cycle of the sensor devices. We explore QoS challenges and perspectives for wireless sensor networks, survey the QoS mechanisms and classify the state of the art QoS-aware MAC protocols together with discussing their advantages and disadvantages. According to this survey, we observe that instead of providing deterministic QoS guarantees, majority of the protocols follow a service differentiation approach by classifying the data packets according to their type (or classes) and packets from different classes are treated according to their requirements by tuning the associated network parameters at the MAC layer. Design tradeoffs and open research issues are also investigated to point out the further possible research directions in the field of QoS provisioning in wireless sensor networks at the MAC layer.},

	Abstract = {Recent advancement in micro-electromechanical systems (mems) have enabled the development of Wireless sensor Network (WSN) which is gaining popularity day by day and is used in wide range of applications. The sensor nodes that constitute WSN have several constraints like limited battery power, memory constraint, limited bandwidth etc. Therefore designing an efficient MAC layer protocol is a challenging task. TDMA-based MAC protocols can avoid collisions, overhearing and idle listening and therefore energy efficient. In this paper, we firstly describe a brief account of the factors influencing WSN MAC design. Then, we describe several TDMA-based MAC protocols both centralized and distributed which are proposed so far for wireless sensor network.},
